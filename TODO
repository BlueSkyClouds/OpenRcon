OpenRcon:
    - Get an new application logo.
    - Implement language option to Settings.
    - Implement a type of class that handle connection requests, like create tab etc, manage closing of it.
    - Implement working plugin system that can be used by games to add more functionality.
    - When connect to a server, check that a similar connection not already exists.
    - Update the comboBox_sm when a server is added, modified or removed in ServerListDialog.

    Frostbite:
        - Debug and fix the "wrong word size" sigsegv error. - FIXED.
        - Check that the game matches the server on connect, if not close connection.
        - Rewrite the FrostbiteCommandHandler to parse responses, and add functions for sending commands.
          The question is: How to do this without causing SIGSEGV, because FrostbiteCommandHandler needs to hold derived FrostbiteConnection and FrostBiteCommandHandler objects.
        - Implement check that packets never is bigger than 16384 bytes.

    BFBC2:
        - List bans in BanList.
        - Rewrite playerlist to use signals.
        - Fix crash when click Run in maplist.
		
    BF3:
        - All we need for this is a BF3 server to test with, possible to use any public server but only for non-login commands. Tested that the Frostbite implementation works on BF3 as well.
		
    BF4:
        - Fix malfunction when removing multiplue maps from the current list.
        - Implement move menu in treeWidget_players_playerList with teams and squads.
        - Implement dictionary for lookup team name by current level, gamemode and the team id.

    Minecraft:
        - Fix that we're getting strange letters mixed up with the response. NOTE: Seems to be caused by that we reads char* not unsigned char*
